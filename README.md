## General info
This project is a Windows Forms Application.  
The main purpose is to set tasks for bees.   
There are six kinds of jobs bees can take: teaching young bees, eggs care, keeping the hive, honey production, collecting nectar, patrol with stings.  
Not every bee can do every task. 
Every job can last one or more shifts.  
There are four bees available.  
After assigning tasks, press the button 'Work through next shift'. It will generate a report about which shift is that, which bee has done which task and how many shifts has it left.
